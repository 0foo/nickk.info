Hi, I'm a tech professional originally from New Orleans but have worked remotely on and off for a decade. <br/> 
I love technology and building things, and  being from New Orleans, love eating. <br/>
I also have a dog named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/travels_with_biscuit/">Biscuit</a>. <br/>
