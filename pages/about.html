Hi, I'm a tech professional originally from New Orleans but working remotely from various places.

I spend most of my time at dog parks trying to excercise my energy filled <a href="https://www.instagram.com/travels_with_biscuit/">dog</a> 
and trying to get these infernal computers to do my bidding.  
I also tinker on guitar and am from New Orleans so am always on the lookout for good restaraunts.
