Hi, I'm a tech professional originally from New Orleans but working remotely from various places. <br/> 
I spend most of my time at either at dog parks or trying to get infernal computers to do my bidding.    <br/> 
I also tinker on guitar, enjoy hiking, and being from New Orleans am always on the lookout for good restaraunts.  <br/>
