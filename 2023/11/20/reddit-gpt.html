* He addresses concerns about the impact of API changes on the blind community and the visually impaired, emphasizing the commitment to keep content accessible and working with apps like RedReader and Dystopia to ensure they can continue to access the Data API​
* Spez discusses re-enabling pushshift for mod use cases and ensuring non-commercial, accessibility-focused apps have free access to the Data API​
* He confirms that the API is not going away and is part of the web redesign plan​.

  <li>Chat GPT</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The fields in the "spez.txt" file, based on the structure of the comments, are as follows:

    comment_title: The title of the Reddit post or thread where the comment was made.
    comment_text: The actual text of the comment made by 'spez'.
    comment_id: The unique identifier for the comment on Reddit.
    comment_context_link: The URL to the specific comment on Reddit, providing context for where the comment appears.
    comment_parent: The text of the parent comment or post to which 'spez' is responding, if applicable.

These fields collectively provide a structured view of each comment, its context, and its location within the Reddit platform.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The most interesting aspect in my opinion is the ability to recognize fields once prompted with zero assistance and learn about them for future actions.</p>
