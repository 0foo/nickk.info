This is the latest iteration of this blog, after approx a million iterations over many years.  I have more fun making the blog than actually posting to it. 


Not much else to say other than this time around everyting is raw css, html, and whatnot for the design and layout and Jekyll to generate all the static files.

<u>Learnings/Impressions</u>  
* CSS...why?
* Why does an image have to be set to `display:block` to not have a margin at the bottom? 
* Why is `margin-left:1rem;` not the default for list items and why is `list-style-position: inside` almost there except that on the newline the text flows under the bullet.
* So many more CSS questions.
* On the bright side: Flexbox is awesome. 
* Using rem units is awesome.
* I wish there was a debug tool that you could turn on in the browser to add 1px borders to some/all elements.
* `position:fixed` with a div spacer of the same height underneath is a cool way to make a sticky nav bar. 
* I made a side bar but not sure what to do with it yet.
