This is the latest iteration of this blog, after approx a million iterations over a long time.  


Not much else to say other than this time around everyting is raw css, html, and whatnot for the design and layout and Jekyll to generate all the static files.

As a backend developer mostly, CSS is stressful in that there's a significant amount of non-intuitive gotchas just built in. 

I could see how a front end CSS guru is worth their weight in gold.

<u>Various Learnings/Impressions</u>  
## CSS
* Images:
    * Why does an image have to be set to `display:block` to not have a margin at the bottom? 
    * Found it to be a struggle to vertically center an image inside of an inline-block parent container which is inside flexbox element.

* List/Bullets:
    * Why is `margin-left:1rem;` not the default for list items 
    * why is `list-style-position: inside` almost there except that on the newline the text flows under the bullet, instead of indenting.

* code blocks and pre tag
    * Would like the code block background to only expand to the width of the text instead of all across the screen. Needs more research.
    *  This caused me a headache as the pre tag has presets that ignore style rules and break your layout by not shrinking properly.
    * This is the fix:
    * ```css
pre {
    min-width: -webkit-fill-available;
    min-width: -moz-available;
    min-width: stretch;
    max-width: 0;
}
```

* overflow
    * overflow: auto vs overflow: scroll
    * scroll bars break border-radius 

* The good
    * Flexbox is awesome generally.
    * Using rem units is cool.
    * `position:fixed` with a div spacer of the same height underneath is a cool way to make a sticky nav bar.
